High:
- Switch to using ILR list object for computations, it should store the original and transformed data (optionally), the tree, the weights, etc… This also makes it compatible with phylofactor
- - Document package - see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html - Add this as a readme file to github. 
- export c.to.nn and t.to.nn 
- t.to.nn - make which== a which %in% so its vectorized
- add README.md for github
- change philr behavior to use shiftp rather than acomp stuff. 
- Clean up plot_utils and replace some with geom_balance
- Finish Description of Package in Description file. 

Medium:
- Prettify output of return.votes from name.balance
- allow plot_balance to handle situation when up or down is a tip
- add phylum bar to plot_balance
- calc.blw - add option to not add pseudocount
- Figure out where to put data - or add comments / list how it was generated/preprocessed in its documentation.
- Deal with namespace collisions - can I do anything about these?
- clean up namebalance.R and plot_utils.R - separate to multiple files.
- Allow return.votes to be specified at a given level (e.g., phylum)
- ? color_tax option in plot_density_breakdown_wtree ? - I don’t even know what that is
- Make sure ggtree adds changes to gheatmap otherwise integrate new version of gheatmap into philr
- plot.taxa has trouble with missing values 

- add option for philr function to be silent and not print
-add citation information to package http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/inst.html

LOW:
make name.balance example more interesting (rather than n32)
add recommends phylofactor
Update name.balance to take vector of coordinates to name
update name.balance to throw meaningful error if named balance is not in tree.
remove tip.boosted
