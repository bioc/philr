High:
- add README.md for github
- change philr behavior to use shiftp rather than acomp stuff. 
- Finish Description of Package in Description file. 
- Document package - see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html - Add this as a readme file to github.
- Can I include CSS in my package - the filtering and stuff was done by dan knights? 
- make sure dataset is documented in philr and not just CSS - or make sure philr imports CSS and remove dataset from philr (probably better). 
- Switch to using ILR list object for computations, it should store the original and transformed data (optionally), the tree, the weights, etc… This also makes it compatible with phylofactor

CLEANUP PLOTTING: 
- Ask ggtree if it would like to include geom_balance
- Clean up plot_utils and replace some with geom_balance
- allow plot_balance to handle situation when up or down is a tip
- add phylum bar to plot_balance
- clean up namebalance.R and plot_utils.R - separate to multiple files.
- plot.taxa has trouble with missing values 
- ? color_tax option in plot_density_breakdown_wtree ? - I don’t even know what that is
- Make sure ggtree adds changes to gheatmap otherwise integrate new version of gheatmap into philr


Medium:
- Prettify output of return.votes from name.balance
- calc.blw - add option to not add pseudocount  
- add option to suppress warning on calculate.blw 
- Figure out where to put data - or add comments / list how it was generated/preprocessed in its documentation.
- Deal with namespace collisions - can I do anything about these?
- Allow return.votes to be specified at a given level (e.g., phylum)
- add option for philr function to be silent and not print
- add citation information to package http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/inst.html
- convert to long :  #TODO: expand to labels can be an entire dataframe of metadata to add on

LOW:
make name.balance example more interesting (rather than n32)
add recommends phylofactor
Update name.balance to take vector of coordinates to name
update name.balance to throw meaningful error if named balance is not in tree.
remove tip.boosted
- Create Cheatsheet
