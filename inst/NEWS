CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0
--------------------------
  
    - removed deprecated functions (c.to.nn and t.to.nn)
    - removed options for parallel processing in phylo2sbp, with the 
      algorithmic speedups to this function parallel processing 
      is superfluous and not used (even for trees of >45,000 leaves). 
    - Updated introduction to philr-intro vignette. 
    - Added Install instructions (from source) to readme
    - Added citation info to readme (paper not on bioRxiv)

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3.0
--------------------------

  INTERNAL
    - Fixed confusing difference between gp.rowMeans and g.colMeans (now
    gp.rowMeans -> g.rowMeans)
    - Bug Fixes

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.4
--------------------------

    - Introduced new vignette ('philr-intro') based on Global Patterns dataset
    from phyloseq
    - name.to.nn which (as well as nn.to.name) are now exported!
    - internal plotting functions replaced with annotate_balance and new
    geom_balance which was implemented in the package ggtree.
    - resolved anorm vs. enorm bug (previously anorm was calculating the
    euclidean norm due to subsetting behavior in compositions package). With
    this, also removed dependency on compositions package and reimplemented
    closure in philr.

  INTERNAL
    - gp.rowMeans and g.colMeans now handle calculation of geometric means
    for rows and columns respectively. Note 'gp' because rowMeans for rows
    needs to be calculated with weights. (See reference in the documentation
    for that function).

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.3
--------------------------

    - Weighted / Genralized ILR functions now exported (shiftp, clrp, ilrp,
    buildilrBasep)
    - renamed function blw.mean.descendants to mean_dist_to_tips
    -  t.to.nn and c.to.nn replaced by name.to.nn which (as well as nn.to.name)
    are now vectorized.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.0
--------------------------

    - Basic functions from paper in added
    - name.balance can now show vote tallies
    - philr function now warns if zeroes present
    - added convert_to_long function
