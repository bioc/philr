Description: PhILR is short for Phylogenetic Isometric Log-Ratio Transform.
 This package provides functions for the analysis of compositional
 data (e.g., data representing proportions of different variables/parts). Specifically
 this package allows analysis of compositional data where the parts can be
 related through a phylogenetic tree and makes available the Isometric Log Ratio
 transform build from the phylogenetic tree and utilizing a weighted reference
 measure.
