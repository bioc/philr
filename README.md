*A phylogenetic transform for analysis for analysis of compositional microbiome data*

***
PhILR = Phylogenetic Isometric Log-Ratio Transform.
This package provides functions for the analysis of compositional data (e.g., data representing proportions of different variables/parts). Specifically this package allows analysis of compositional data where the parts can be related through a phylogenetic tree and makes available the Isometric Log Ratio transform build from the phylogenetic tree and utilizing a weighted reference measure.
